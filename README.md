# EasyChat

Easy Chat is a simple Chat tool that enables the ability to place a chat on your website. 

There are two versions:

-Community Chat 

-Customer Support Chat

Each version has it's own set of features. 

This is simply a project created for me to learn. So here in the early days, some of the code is borrowed. 
A list of these are located <a href="https://github.com/jdc20181/EasyChat/wiki/Sources-for-Early-Versions-of-EasyChat">Here</a>
